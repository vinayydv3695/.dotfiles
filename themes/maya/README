1. INTRODUCTION

  In Hindi, 'maya' refers to 'material wealth'.

  This is a simple 'material' inspired SDDM theme.


2. BACKGROUND

   While contributing new translations, I tried testing them on
   my working Linux machine. But only few strings appeared to be
   translated.

   Took some time, to discover that SDDM theme on my desktop was
   not using strings from SDDM. Few other themes I tried, weren't
   using all the strings.

   Necessity to test translations was the driving force behind
   this theme. The 'material' inspiration helps in keeping focus
   on original intent.
