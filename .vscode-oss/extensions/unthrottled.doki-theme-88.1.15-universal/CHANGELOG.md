# Change Log

## 88.5-1.6.1 [Cleanups]

- Added better checksum restoration error message.
- Updated Sagiri's syntax highlighting color a bit.

## 88.3-1.5.2 [Hide Watermark Restore]

![Hidden Watermark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15972415/216770850-7dc66024-78f5-4503-ae15-2dc087def6cd.png)

## 88.3-1.5.1 [Terminal Wallpaper Bugfix]

![Terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15972415/213933498-b8d0697a-46d2-4a5f-ab43-830d9fd8231a.png)

## 88.3-1.5.0 [Semantic Highlighting]

- Themes now support [semantic highliglighting](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide#semantic-coloring-in-color-themes). Which I tried to make as similar to [the WebStorm plugin syntax highlighting](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-jetbrains). 
  - If you don't like what I did, then you can always add `"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": false,` to your `settings.json` in your VSCode to turn off semantic highlighting :)

![Comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15972415/209368481-0c8a2d07-4195-40d1-9cd7-994833a71091.png)

## 88.1.3.1 [Sticker Z-Index Fix]

- Placing the sticker at the proper z-index such that it no longer blocks the: Notifications & Status Bar Tooltips. Please re-install your sticker for this to take effect!

# 88.1-1.3.0 [Darling]

Best Girl just got _better_. ❤️

![Best Girl](https://doki.assets.unthrottled.io/misc/best_girl.png)

_Zero Two's Not Just A Cutie. ;)_

**4 New Themes!**

- I decided that I didn't have enough Zero Two themes, so I fixed that. She now has a new top-tier dark hacker theme: `Obsidian`. I also felt like Red Zero Two doesn't get enough attention, so I added a light `Sakura` theme which features her as she was as a child. With all these new Zero Two themes, I thought it would be best to rename the existing dark & light themes to `Rose` & `Lily` respectively.
- It wouldn't be the _Darling_ release if I didn't include Hiro as well. (Dark Theme)
- Lastly, this is the first release with a duo theme! (Nao's doesn't count, I just wanted the melon meme.) Just to pad my Zero Two theme stats, I've now got a Hiro & Zero Two couples' dark theme.

### Other Stuff

- Desaturated Itsuki's theme a bit.
- It was brought to my attention that I cannot spell "Rimuru".
- Zero Two's Obsidian theme is the default theme now.

# 84.2-1.3.0 [Enhancements n Stuff]

- Added the ability to control the position & size of the sticker using the `doki.sticker.css` configruation property.
- Fixed artifacted background images on the extension list tree & settings UI selected config (be sure to re-install your wallpaper for this to take effect).
- Restored asset installation on code-server (please be sure to clear caches and hard reload!)
- Added Remote Development Server/SSH connection asset installation help instructions.

# 84.2-1.2.1 [Small Dart Enhancement]

- Enhanced Dart syntax highlighting a bit.

# 84.1-1.2.0 [Light Theme Release]

![v84 Girls](https://doki.assets.unthrottled.io/misc/v84_girls.png)

This release is not for my Dark Theme Normies. Dark themes are nice, but I like Light Themes too (and my Dark Theme Normies). I'm currently trying new things out. Sorry in advance if I made your eyes bleed. I might tweak some of them as time goes on, still not 100% on what looks good & also is a fun color.

**6 New Light Themes!**

- Tired & broken down programmers rejoice! Even though you will never be pampered by a real Fox-demigod, you can now at least code with one. Let "The Helpful Fox Senko-san" watch over you as complete your tickets. You can almost feel the "おかえりなのじゃ" you will never get 😭
- I decided to complete my Quintessential Quintuplets collection by adding the oldest and youngest quint: Nakano Ichika & Nakano Itsuki.
- Tomori Nao, from Charlotte, has an interesting dichotomy when it comes to her personality. She is super cute tho.
- Have I ever seen Code Geass? No. Can I appreciate C.C. without having seen the anime? Yeah buddy.
- Guess while I'm talking about "anime I haven't seen but, chose to make a theme because the girl is pretty." We now have Yuzuriha Inori from Guilty Crown.

### Other Stuff

- Adjusted Sayori's dark diff deleted color & updated Satsuki's light autocomplete letter match color.

# 78.2-1.2.0 [Asset Settings & Custom Status Bar Name]

- Added the following settings that allow you to control what assets get installed during the `Install Wallpaper` actions.
  - `doki.background.enabled`: Whether you want an image in your empty editor background when when running the 'Install Wallpaper' command.
  - `doki.wallpaper.enabled`: Whether you want an image on top of your code editor, when running the 'Install Wallpaper' command.
- Enhanced the 'Settings (UI)' wallpaper experience.
- You can also set your own name that shows up next to the ❤ in the status bar now with the `doki.statusbar.name` setting. 

# 78.2-1.1.0 [Themed Bracket Pair Colorization]

- Since VS Code 1.67, [bracket pair colorization](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_67#_bracket-pair-colorization-enabled-by-default) is on by default. Well the default colors where cramping my style, so I fixed that. If you don't what I did, you can customize it yourself [search for "editorBracketHighlight.foreground" on this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color#editor-colors) and also see [customizing a color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_customizing-a-color-theme).

![Themed Brace Matching](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15972415/167956580-ba51862a-8d31-4d1a-9cbe-fb3676f33152.png)

# 78.2-1.0.2 [Major Theme Syntax Coloring Updates]

- **Major Updates** to syntax highlighting colors to these themes:
  - Asuna Dark
  - Beatrice
  - Emilia Light.
  - Ibuki Light
  - Monika Dark/Light
  - Natsuki Dark/Light
  - Sayori Dark/Light
  - Yuri Dark/Light
- Minor syntax highlighting updates to these themes: Nakano Miku, Megumin, Mai Dark, Ryuko Dark, Tohsaka Rin,
  Rias: Crimson, Mai Light, and Asuna Light
- Small syntax highlighting usability updates to these themes: Zero Two Dark, Yukino, Hanekawa,
  Nagatoro, Rei, Astolfo, Echidna, Shima Rin, Sonoda Umi, Kurisu, & Ishtar Dark
- Made the background art brighter for: Satsuki Dark & Asuna Dark
- Made background art dimmer for: Yuri Light.

#### Motivation

I am in a position where I will now regularly be using my light themes more often. I am also planning on adding more.
Most of my light themes were created a long time ago and my tastes have evolved over time.
I have taken the time to revisit a fair number of my legacy themes, light and dark.

Thank you for your understanding!

# 78.0-1.0.2 [The Boys]

I'm trying to bring in a bit of inclusion.

**4 New Dark Themes!**

- I can already hear you now, "Rimuru Tempest, from 'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime', is not a boy. They are the best genderless slime, get your facts correct." Yeah well....shut up.
- Next, is one of the S ranked heroes in the 'One Punch Man' universe, Genos.
- After that, is the smug smile of Yukihira Soma from Shokugeki no Soma. 
- Lastly, I am going to be honest, I haven't seen Haikyu. I just wanted a Indigo & Orange based theme. So here is Hinata Shoyo.

# 74.1-1.0.0 [Synapse break. Vanishment, this world!]

**4 New Dark Themes!**

- Decimate errors in the code alongside the Wicked Lord Shingan. Let your inner fantasies go rampant with Rikka Takanashi from: "Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions". 
- It is comfy time! Don't let feature requests stress you out, because you can now code with Nadeshiko from Yuru Camp. 
- A Certain Scientific RailGun go: bzzzzzzt. Zap bugs out of existence with the electromaster Mikoto Misaka.
- Raccoon + Tanuki = one really cute cinnamon bun. Enjoy your time coding with Raphtalia from: "Rising of the Shield Hero."

Yotsuba, from The Quintessential Quintuplets, isn't 2spooky4me.
